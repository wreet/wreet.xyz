Hello all, it’s been a while. I’ve decided to finally get around to sharing some of the things that I have been working on the last little bit, and that can only mean one thing: it’s time for a new personal blog! Here I intend to share some of the security-related tools I have been working on, recently uncovered bugs, tutorials and occasional comments on news within the infosec world. 

Here you will find the links to the latest versions of my fuzzers, along with information on how to use them and changes I intend to make in the future. I will also be sharing with you bugs uncovered while using them and other tools. 

In addition, you’ll find some of the tools I use everyday during my work as a webapp pentester, including XSS helpers, a clickjack builder, a webhook to dump client connection information, my attack payloads database and many more to come.

I hope you’ll find this content helpful, and be sure to stay tuned for more!
