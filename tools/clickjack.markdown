Just a simple page to test for potential clickjacking issues. Place your URL at the end of the clickjacker pageâ€™s using a hash: [http://wreet.xyz/t/clickjackt.html#http://joncornwell.com](http://wreet.xyz/t/clickjackt.html#http://joncornwell.com)

Looks like Jon needs to do more to prevent potential clickjacking!

The page can be accessed over either HTTP or HTTPS in order to be able to test pages using both. You may need to ctrl-shift-reload to prevent loading from cache if you've already tested a page.
